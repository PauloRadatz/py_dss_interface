`py-dss-interface` is a Python package to control **OpenDSS Powered by [EPRI](https://www.epri.com/)** — **the official EPRI-maintained distribution of OpenDSS** — using the Python programming language. **It is designed to work with OpenDSS Powered by EPRI only**. This tool is actively used across multiple EPRI research projects and by utilities and consultants, and it also serves as a foundation for automated testing workflows for OpenDSS.

## 🚀 What Can You Do With `py-dss-interface`?

Use the full power of Python to control and automate your OpenDSS workflows:

- ⚙️ Automate repetitive OpenDSS tasks.
- 🧠 Manipulate circuit, element, and bus properties with Python logic.
- 📊 Extract simulation results and generate custom reports.
- 🧮 Implement advanced analysis and algorithms using Python.

## 🔄 Why Use `py-dss-interface` Instead of the COM Interface?

Compared to the COM interface, `py-dss-interface` provides a modern, Pythonic experience:

- 💡 **Code Completion**: Works seamlessly with IDEs like PyCharm for better developer productivity.
- 📦 **No OpenDSS Installation Required**: No need to install OpenDSS since `py-dss-interface` comes bundled with a tested version of OpenDSS (Windows and Linux). However, you may also use a different OpenDSS version if desired. Please note that compatibility is only guaranteed for the bundled version.
- 🔄 **Supports Multiple DSS Objects**: Interact with multiple OpenDSS objects at the same time.
- 🌐 **Multi-Platform**: Supports both **Windows** and **Linux** (pre-built wheels available; build from source if needed).
- ⚡ **Better Performance**: Some examples comparing performance will be provided later.
- 🔐 **Version Control Friendly**: Avoid breaking your Python code when updating the OpenDSS version on your computer.

## 💻 Platform Support

### ✅ Windows
```bash
pip install py-dss-interface
```

### 🐧 Linux

Pre-built wheels are available for x86_64 and ARM64. Start with pip install:

```bash
pip install py-dss-interface
```

If pip install doesn't work for your environment, you can build from source as described below.

#### 🔧 Build from source (fallback)

To use `py-dss-interface` on Linux, you'll need to build the OpenDSS C++ engine locally using `OpenDSSLinuxCPPForRepo.sh`.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PauloRadatz/py_dss_interface.git
   cd py_dss_interface
   ```

2. **Build the OpenDSS C++ engine**
   ```bash
   bash py_dss_interface/OpenDSSLinuxCPPForRepo.sh
   ```
   📌 **Note:** You'll need tools for building C++ code (e.g., `g++`, `cmake`, etc.).

3. **Install the package**
   ```bash
   pip install path/to/py_dss_interface
   ```

## 📦 Quickstart Example

```python
import py_dss_interface

dss = py_dss_interface.DSS()
dss.text("compile path/to/circuit.dss")
dss.text("solve")
print(dss.circuit.total_power)
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

The project includes a comprehensive test suite using pytest. Tests can be run individually or together depending on your platform and backend.

### Basic Test Execution

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/
```

### Test Execution Modes

#### Automatic Individual Execution (Default)

On **Linux** or when using the **C++ backend on Windows**, tests automatically run individually in separate subprocesses to prevent memory leak issues. This is handled automatically by the test framework.

#### Running All Tests Together

To run all tests together (faster execution, but may have memory issues if there are leaks), use the `--run-together` flag:

```bash
# Run all tests together (even on Linux/C++)
pytest tests/ --run-together
```

**Note:** Use `--run-together` when you want to test memory management fixes or need faster test execution. Individual execution is recommended for normal testing to prevent memory leaks.

### Test Summary

When tests run individually, a detailed summary is displayed at the end showing:
- Total tests executed
- Passed/Failed/Error counts
- List of failed tests (if any)
- Execution time
