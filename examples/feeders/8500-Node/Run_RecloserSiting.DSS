// Define a relay at the substation with default TCC Curves and high pickup values to get by solution
// without tripping
New Relay.SubBreaker Line.ln5815900-1 1  PhaseCurve=D GroundCurve=A PhaseTrip=600 GroundTrip=600

Set Maxiterations=20     ! Sometimes the solution takes more than the default 15 iterations

Solve

// Set the triplex failure rate to zero so it does not affect the relcalc
Redirect TplxFaultrate.dss  ! set to zero

// Stick some fuses on
Redirect Fuses.DSS
interpolate  ! to get rid of gaps in circuit plotting
